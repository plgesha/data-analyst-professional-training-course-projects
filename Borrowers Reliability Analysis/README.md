[NBViewer - Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/plgesha/data-analyst-professional-training-course-projects/blob/master/Borrowers%20Reliability%20Analysis/borrowers_reliability_analysis.ipynb)

## Objective

The client is a bank’s credit department. The task is to define if timeliness of loan repayment is affected by a client’s marital status or the number of children in their household. The data provided by the bank is statistics on the solvency of their customers. The results then may be used when building a credit scoring model. 

## Data

- `children` — number of children
- `days_employed` — total work experience in days
- `dob_years` — age in years
- `education` — level of education
- `education_id` — level of education ID
- `family_status` — family status
- `family_status_id` — family status ID
- `gender` — gender
- `income_type` — employment type
- `debt` — the fact of having a credit debt
- `total_income` — monthly income
- `purpose` — purpose of the loan

## Key results

The analysis shows that the most reliable borrowers:  
— have no children   
— are married or have ever been married   
— have *real estate* as a purpose of getting a loan    
— have a high level of earnings (higher than 80% of borrowers).
