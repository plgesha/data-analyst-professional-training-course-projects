# Creating Analytical Dashboard for a Personal Recommendation Service

## Objective
The customer is Yandex.Zen (a blogging platform and a content feed with personal recommendations).

- creating a dashboard in Tableau based on the csv file in accordance with the agreed layout;
- creating a summary presentation for managers on the current situation of user interaction with article cards.

## Key results
