# Creating Analytical Dashboard for a Personal Recommendation Service

## Objective
The customer is Yandex.Zen (a blogging platform and a content feed with personal recommendations). The task is to help automate repetitive weekly reports on user interaction with article cards by building a dashboard. The resulting dashboard is based on a pipeline developed by data engineers and created following the terms of reference agreed with managers and database administrators. 

This project consists of three parts:
- [data extraction](https://github.com/plgesha/data-analyst-professional-training-course-projects/blob/master/Creating%20Analytical%20Dashboard%20for%20a%20Personal%20Recommendation%20Service%20/data_extraction.ipynb) (connect to the database, export data from a table to a csv file);
- creating a dashboard in Tableau based on the csv file in accordance with the agreed layout;
