# User Behaviour Analysis in a Classified Ads App (Gumtree/Craigslist/Avito-like)

[NBViewer - Jupyter Notebook]()

## Objective
The task is to analyse user behaviour and its connection to the desired customer action â€” contact viewing. The datasets provided contain user activities within the app for buying and selling pre-owned items. 

This project consists of several parts:
- Analyse the connection between the desired customer action (contact viewing) and other user actions;
- Define what actions are most often performed by users who view contacts;
- Test three hypotheses on contact viewing conversion;
- Create a dashboard in Tableau in accordance with the agreed layout;
- Summarise results into a presentation.

## Key results
- main insights:
    - Viewing recommendations, photos, and independent search are the most frequent actions prior to contact viewing;
    - Users who viewed contacts are more likely to view photos, add ads to favourites, and click on recommended ads than those who did not view contacts;
    - Users who viewed photos and added adds to favourites convert to contact viewing more frequently than those who didn't;
    - Hypotheses testing showed that looking through recommendations and photos as well as adding ads to favourites have an impact on the desired customer action.
