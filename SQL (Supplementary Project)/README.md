# SQL (Supplementary Project)

## Objective
The client is a company that recently bought an ebook subscription service startup. The task is to look into the database  containing info on books, publishers, authors, and users’ book reviews to help create a new product value proposition.

Main tasks:
- Find out how many books have been published since January 1, 2000;
- For each book, calculate the number of reviews and the average rating;
- Identify the publisher that has released the largest number of books longer than 50 pages — in this way brochures are being excluded from the analysis;
- Identify the author with the highest average book rating (taking into account only books with 50 or more rates);
- Calculate the average number of reviews from users who have given more than 50 rates. 

## Key results
- 819 books have been published since January 1, 2000;
