# A/B Test Results Analysis (Supplementary Project)

## Objective
The client is an international online shop. The task is to finish and analyse the results of the A/B test that was run by a previous analyst. The data provided is the user action dataset as well as terms of reference and several supporting datasets.

## Key results
**Сompliance with the terms of reference**
- number of participants: expected — 6000, actual — 6351;
- stop date: expected — 4 Jan 2021, actual — 30 Dec 2020 (last event date);
- audience (% of new users from the EU region): expected — 15%, actual — 13,7%;

**A/B test results**
The conversion funnel and hypothesis testing showed that the expected effect of at least 10% conversion increase did not occur, — on the contrary, the test group showed worse results.

**Recommendations**
- clearly the test was not well conducted: it was run in a very busy period of pre-Christmas and in parallel with marketing campaigns and another A/B test; it also had suboptimal division into groups;
- given the above it might make sense to choose a better time and run a test again with a correct division into groups.
