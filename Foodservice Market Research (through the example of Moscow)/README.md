# Foodservice Market Research (through the example of Moscow)

## Objective
The task is to conduct research on the current foodservice market situation for a stakeholder — a group of investors, to help them decide whether to invest in the new cafe opening and chain expansion. The data used is open data on food and drink venues in Moscow. 

## Key results
The result is a presentation for a stakeholder showcasing:
— percentage ratio of venue types;
— proportion of chain and independent venues;
— average number of seats by venue type;
— top-10 streets and neighbourhoods by number of venues; 
— recommendations on type of venue, number of seats and location for opening a new cafe.
